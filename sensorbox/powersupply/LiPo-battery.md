Lithium-based batteries are highly versatile due to their high speed and power.

However, it is important to handle these batteries correctly, as misuse of a LiPo battery can result in melting, ignition, or even explosion.

A typical charging cycle for a LiPo battery is divided into 3 charging phases, based on battery voltage.

1. Trickle Charge
At low battery voltage, the internal resistance becomes very high. To prevent damage to the battery, the charging current should also remain low during low battery voltages.

2. Constant Current Charge
Once the battery voltage is high enough, the battery can be charged at a constant current. It is generally recommended to charge the battery at a maximum of 1C and preferably even at 0.5C. C represents the charge/discharge capacity, expressed in mAh or Ah.

3. Constant Voltage Charge
When the battery voltage approaches its maximum, it switches to constant voltage charging, where the voltage remains constant to allow the battery to reach and maintain its maximum voltage. During this charging phase, the current gradually decreases to zero as the battery reaches its capacity.
