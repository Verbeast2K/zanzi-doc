#Power supply proof of concept

As a proof of concept for the power supply, we are using a small solar cell with a voltage of 5V and a current of 200mA, a 1250mAh LiPo battery, and a DFR0059 solar power manager from DFRobot. The solar power manager will utilize the energy from the solar cell to charge the battery.
